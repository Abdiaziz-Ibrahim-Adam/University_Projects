# Huffman Compression Project

This project implements a Huffman coding algorithm for text compression. It includes functionality to encode and decode text files using Huffman trees.

## Features
- Compress text files using Huffman coding.
- Decode compressed files to their original format.
- Efficient data structures for frequency tables, Huffman trees, and priority queues.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** C
- **Build Tool:** Makefile

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler (or equivalent C compiler)

### Build and Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zizo-1/University_Projects/Huffman_Project.git
   cd Huffman_Project
