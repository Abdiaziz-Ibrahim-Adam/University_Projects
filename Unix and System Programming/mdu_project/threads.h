 * This module handles the creation, initialization, and management of threads within a thread pool.
 * It includes functions for setting up a thread pool, dispatching threads, and coordinating their 
 * activity for concurrent processing of directory and file paths. It also provides cleanup functions 
 * to properly release resources when threads complete their tasks.
